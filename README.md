# Parallel-ACO
A parallel implementation of Ant Colony Optimisation for TSP with mpic.

## Datasets
We use the following three datasets for testing:
* [TSPLIB](https://github.com/mastqe/tsplib)
    This uses nodes with x and y coordinates.
* [National TSP](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/world/countries.html)
* [VLSI Dataset](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/vlsi/summary.html)x
